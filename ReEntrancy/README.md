# Re-entrancy

The goal of this level is for you to steal all the funds from the contract.

  Things that might help:

Untrusted contracts can execute code where you least expect it.
Fallback methods
Throw/revert bubbling
Sometimes the best way to attack a contract is with another contract.
See the "?" page above, section "Beyond the console"
